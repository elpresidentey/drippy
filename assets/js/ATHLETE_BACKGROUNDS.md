# Athlete Background System

## Overview

The athlete background system adds dynamic, low-opacity athlete images to collection sections, creating visual interest while maintaining focus on the product cards. The system features smooth transitions, performance optimization, and accessibility considerations.

## Features

### Dynamic Background Rotation
- **15-second intervals**: Backgrounds rotate automatically every 15 seconds
- **Smooth transitions**: 1-second fade between images
- **Multiple images per section**: 3 curated athlete images per collection
- **Performance optimized**: Images are preloaded for smooth transitions

### Section-Specific Athletes

#### Hottest Collections
- Basketball player in action
- Dynamic runner in motion  
- Fitness athlete training

#### Trending Collections
- Street athlete in urban setting
- Dynamic runner with energy
- Basketball action shot

#### Upcoming Sneakers
- Futuristic athlete with tech gear
- High-performance sports action
- Next-gen athletic performance

#### Fresh Drops
- Street style athlete
- Urban lifestyle athlete
- Active lifestyle imagery

### Visual Design

#### Opacity & Filtering
- **8% opacity**: Subtle background presence
- **Grayscale filter**: 20% desaturation for consistency
- **Blur effect**: 0.5px blur for softer appearance
- **Gradient overlay**: Subtle contrast enhancement

#### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile optimization**: Reduced to 5% opacity on smaller screens
- **Dark mode support**: Adjusted opacity and brightness
- **Reduced motion**: Respects user accessibility preferences

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Architecture
```css
.athlete-background-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  z-index: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.athlete-background-layer {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out;
  filter: grayscale(20%) blur(0.5px);
}

.athlete-background-layer.active {
  opacity: 0.08;
}
```

### JavaScript Management
```javascript
class AthleteBackgrounds {
  constructor() {
    this.rotationInterval = 15000; // 15 seconds
    this.athleteImages = { /* curated image collections */ };
  }
  
  rotateBackgrounds() {
    // Smooth fade transitions between images
  }
}
```

## Image Sources

All athlete images are sourced from Unsplash with proper optimization:

### URL Structure
```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3
```

### Parameters
- **Quality**: 80% for optimal balance
- **Width**: 1200px for high-resolution displays
- **Format**: Auto-format (WebP where supported)
- **Fit**: Crop for consistent framing

## Performance Optimizations

### Preloading
- All athlete images are preloaded on page load
- Prevents loading delays during transitions
- Improves user experience with smooth transitions

### Lazy Loading
- Background images load after critical content
- Non-blocking implementation
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Memory Management
- Efficient image rotation without memory leaks
- Proper cleanup of unused image elements
- Optimized for long-running sessions

## Accessibility Features

### Reduced Motion Support
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .athlete-background-layer {
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- `aria-hidden="true"` on background containers
- No interference with screen reader navigation
- Purely decorative implementation

### High Contrast Mode
- Enhanced visibility adjustments
- Proper contrast ratios maintained
- Fallback styling for accessibility tools

## Browser Compatibility

### Modern Browsers
- **Chrome**: Full support with WebP optimization
- **Firefox**: Full support with fallback formats
- **Safari**: Full support with backdrop-filter
- **Edge**: Full support with modern features

### Fallback Support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- CSS-only fallback without JavaScript
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Configuration Options

### Rotation Timing
```javascript
this.rotationInterval = 15000; // Adjust rotation speed
```

### Opacity Levels
```css
.athlete-background-layer.active {
  opacity: 0.08; /* Adjust visibility */
}
```

### Image Collections
```javascript
this.athleteImages = {
  hottest: [/* custom image URLs */],
  trending: [/* custom image URLs */]
};
```

## Integration with Product Cards

### Z-Index Layering
- **Background**: z-index: 0 (athlete images)
- **Content**: z-index: 1 (product grid)
- **Headers**: z-index: 2 (section headers)

### Visual Hierarchy
- Athlete backgrounds enhance without competing
- Product cards remain primary focus
- Section headers have enhanced visibility

### Performance Impact
- Minimal impact on card loading performance
- Independent loading and rendering
- Non-blocking implementation

## Maintenance & Updates

### Adding New Images
```javascript
athleteBackgrounds.updateSectionBackground('hottest', 'new-image-url');
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Check background system status
console.log(athleteBackgrounds.currentImages);
```

### Debugging Tools
- Browser dev tools for CSS inspection
- Console logging for rotation tracking
- Performance monitoring integration

This athlete background system creates an engaging, dynamic visual experience while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility standards.
