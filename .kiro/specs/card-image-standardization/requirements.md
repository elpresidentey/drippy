# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on standardizing all product card images across the Dripz & Kix sneaker website. Currently, the site uses various Unsplash images with inconsistent styling, dimensions, and visual presentation. The goal is to replace all product images with a uniform set of high-quality sneaker images that maintain consistent visual standards, improve brand cohesion, and enhance the overall user experience.

2. WHEN viewing product cards THEN all images SHALL use the same visual style (lighting, background, angle)
3. WHEN comparing product cards THEN the image quality SHALL be consistent across all products
4. WHEN loading product pages THEN all images SHALL maintain the same loading performance characteristics

### Requirement 2

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with slow internet connection, I want product images to load efficiently and gracefully, so that I can browse products without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading product pages THEN images SHALL implement lazy loading for performance
