# Design Document

## Overview

The modernized hero section will transform the current promotional banner layout into a contemporary, engaging design that leverages modern web design principles. The design will maintain all existing content while implementing glassmorphism effects, improved typography hierarchy, enhanced visual composition, and smooth micro-interactions to create a premium user experience that aligns with current design trends.

## Architecture

### Layout Structure
The hero section will maintain its current three-part structure but with enhanced visual treatment:

1. **Main Promotional Banner** - Enhanced with glassmorphism and modern gradient overlays
2. **Featured Product Cards** - Redesigned with improved hover states and modern card styling
3. **Store Highlights** - Modernized with better iconography and spacing

### Visual Hierarchy
- Primary focus: "CLEARANCE SALES" messaging with enhanced typography
- Secondary focus: "UP TO 50% OFF" with modern badge styling  
- Supporting elements: Product cards and store highlights with subtle animations

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Modern Promotional Banner Component

**Visual Design:**
- Implement glassmorphism effect with backdrop-filter blur
- Add subtle gradient overlays for depth
- Enhanced typography with modern font weights and spacing
- Floating badge design for "DISCOUNT ALREADY APPLIED"
- Improved button styling with hover animations

**Technical Implementation:**
```css
.hero-main-banner {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255, 107, 53, 0.9), rgba(247, 147, 30, 0.9));
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border-radius: 24px;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Featured Cards Component

**Visual Design:**
- Modern card styling with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Smooth hover animations with scale and shadow effects
- Improved overlay gradients for better text readability
- Enhanced typography for brand and collaboration text

**Interaction Design:**
- Hover states with gentle scale transforms
- Smooth transitions for all interactive elements
- Focus states for keyboard navigation

### 3. Modernized Store Highlights Component

**Visual Design:**
- Clean, minimal design with improved spacing
- Modern iconography (replacing emoji with SVG icons where appropriate)
- Subtle background treatments
- Better visual separation between items

## Data Models

### Hero Section Configuration
```typescript
interface HeroSection {
  mainBanner: {
    badge: string;
    title: string;
    highlight: string;
    subtitle: string;
    description: string;
    ctaText: string;
    backgroundImage: string;
  };
  featuredCards: FeaturedCard[];
  storeHighlights: StoreHighlight[];
}

interface FeaturedCard {
  id: string;
  image: string;
  brand: string;
  collaboration: string;
  altText: string;
}

interface StoreHighlight {
  icon: string;
  text: string;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Image Loading
- Implement proper fallback images for featured products
- Add loading states with skeleton screens
- Handle failed image loads gracefully with placeholder content

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Optimize image formats (WebP with fallbacks)
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Accessibility Fallbacks
- Provide text alternatives for all visual elements
- Ensure proper contrast ratios in all states
- Implement reduced motion alternatives

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparisons across different viewport sizes
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Dark mode and high contrast mode testing

### Performance Testing
- Core Web Vitals measurement (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Image loading performance analysis
- Animation performance profiling

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast validation
- Focus management verification

### Responsive Testing
- Mobile device testing (320px - 768px)
- Tablet testing (768px - 1024px)  
- Desktop testing (1024px+)
- Orientation change testing

## Modern Design Elements

### Glassmorphism Implementation
- Backdrop-filter blur effects for depth
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with proper contrast
- Subtle border treatments with rgba colors

### Typography Enhancements
- Improved font weight hierarchy
- Better letter spacing and line heights
- Modern text shadow effects for readability

### Animation Strategy
- Subtle entrance animations on scroll
- Smooth hover transitions
- Micro-interactions for user feedback
- Respect for reduced motion preferences

### Color Palette Modernization
- Enhanced gradient combinations
- Improved contrast ratios
- Modern shadow and highlight treatments
- Consistent color temperature throughout

## Implementation Considerations

### CSS Architecture
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Implement modern CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Utilize CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Leverage CSS filters for visual effects

### Performance Optimization
- Use transform and opacity for animations (GPU acceleration)
- Implement will-change property judiciously
- Optimize critical rendering path
- Minimize layout thrashing

### Browser Compatibility
- Provide fallbacks for backdrop-filter
- Ensure graceful degradation for older browsers
- Test across major browser engines
- Implement progressive enhancement
